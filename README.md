| *Supplementary Figure 5: Comparison of MLE and HMeta-d’ estimates of metacognitive efficiency. Figure depicts the fitted individual data points for the MLE (in orange) and HMeta-d' (in blue) models. Ellipses depict the 2D gaussian probability distribution for each model’s parameter estimates, demonstrating the Bayesian shrinkage effect obtained within the HMeta-d' model in pulling noisy parameters close to the group mean. It must be noted that the HMeta-d' data points (blue dots) are subject-level estimates pulled from the hierarchically fit model, and the least-squares line fit through these data is therefore for illustration purposes only and does not reflect the actual fitted Rho values of the model (which are generally lower than those observed her’, see main Figure 3). In general, the HMeta-d' finds similar, but stronger patterns of covariation likely due to the improved signal-to-noise ratio of metacognitive efficiency estimates.* |
